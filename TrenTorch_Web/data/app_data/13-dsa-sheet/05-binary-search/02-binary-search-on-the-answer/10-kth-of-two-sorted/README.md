## Statement

`a` and `b` are each sorted in increasing order. Return the **`k`-th smallest** value of all their values combined (`k = 1` is the smallest). Equal values count separately. The big tests only allow a few hundred reads.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
kth_of_two_sorted([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5)
```

Output:

```text
6
```

Combined: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The 5th smallest is 6.

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
kth_of_two_sorted([1, 2], [], 2)
```

Output:

```text
2
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= k <= len(a) + len(b) <= 4 * 10**5`
- Both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `-10**9 <= value <= 10**9`
- The big tests count how many values you read from each list.

## Theory

This is the median problem with a general `k`. Take `i` values from the shorter list `a` and `k - i` from `b` to form the `k` smallest values. That choice is right when the largest value taken from each list is at most the smallest value **not** taken from the other: `a[i-1] <= b[j]` and `b[j-1] <= a[i]`, with `j = k - i`.

Binary search `i`. The number taken from `a` can be at most `min(k, len(a))`, and at least `k - len(b)` (you cannot take more than `len(b)` from `b`). If `a[i-1] > b[j]` you took too many from `a`; otherwise too few.

When the split is right, the `k`-th smallest value is the larger of the two largest taken values: `max(a[i-1], b[j-1])`. `O(log min(len(a), len(b)))` reads.

## Explanation

`a` is the shorter list. `lo = max(0, k - n)` and `hi = min(k, m)` bound how many values can come from `a`. For each `i` (and `j = k - i`) compute the four boundary values with infinities past the ends. A valid split returns `max(a_left, b_left)`; if `a_left > b_right` lower `hi`, else raise `lo`.
