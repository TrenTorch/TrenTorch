## Statement

Return the number of **bits you must flip** to turn `a` into `b`, that is, the number of positions where `a` and `b` differ in binary. For `a = 10` (`1010`) and `b = 7` (`0111`) the answer is `3`.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
bit_flips_to_convert(10, 7)
```

Output:

```text
3
```

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
bit_flips_to_convert(5, 5)
```

Output:

```text
0
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= a, b < 2**31`

## Theory

`a ^ b` (xor) has a `1` exactly where the bits of `a` and `b` **differ**. So the answer is the number of set bits of `a ^ b`, which you already know how to count.

This number is called the **Hamming distance**. XOR is the natural "difference" operator for bits: `x ^ x = 0` and `x ^ 0 = x`.

## Explanation

`a ^ b` marks the differing positions; Kernighan's loop counts them.
