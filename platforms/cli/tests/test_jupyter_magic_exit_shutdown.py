"""
MC/DC coverage for TrenMagics.exit's kernel-vs-process shutdown decision:
self.shell is not None and hasattr(self.shell, "kernel").

Extreme care here: the False branch of this decision calls os._exit(0),
a real, immediate process termination with no exception raised and no
chance for pytest to report anything -- getting the mock wrong would
silently kill the whole test run. os._exit is mocked before anything
else in every test in this file, and every other side-effecting call
(display, network, sleep) is mocked too so this magic method can be
exercised as a pure decision instead of the real notebook-teardown
sequence it drives in production.
