# TrenTorch: Contributor Docs

Technical design and implementation documentation for the codebase in this repo. Adapted from the [`cs249r-docs`](https://github.com/Shashank-Tripathi-07/cs249r-docs) project's `trentorch/` documentation set, which was written for the upstream [`harvard-edge/cs249r_book`](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book) monorepo (TinyTorch) that this fork, TrenTorch, originates from.

## What's here

| Doc | What it's for |
|---|---|
| [`design.md`](design.md) | What TrenTorch's codebase is, why it's built the way it is, and the full technology stack. Start here. |
| [`implementation.md`](implementation.md) | The file map and real code walkthroughs for the module system and the `tren` CLI. Read this when you're ready to touch code. |
| [`system_design.md`](system_design.md) | How the `tren` CLI and the module pipeline actually work end to end, dependencies, data flow, error handling. |
| [`command-reference.md`](command-reference.md) | Every `tren` CLI command and flag. |
| [`deep-dive.md`](deep-dive.md) | A first-principles walkthrough of what happens from `pip install -e .` through module export to grading. |
| [`coding-style.md`](coding-style.md) | The honest answer to "what linter applies here." |
| [`testing-strategy.md`](testing-strategy.md) | What's tested, why, and where the real risk actually lives, with the export pipeline's known fragility as the central case. |
| [`Changes.md`](Changes.md) | User-facing log of new features, bots, and rules -- what's new for you, kept short and current. |

## What's not here, and why

Two upstream docs were dropped rather than adapted:

- **`ci-workflows.md`**: covered five GitHub Actions workflows (validate, preview, publish, PDF builds) tied to the `harvard-edge/cs249r_book` repository's own secrets and deploy targets. None of that CI/CD exists in this fork.
- **`perspective.md`**: recorded the upstream maintainer's governance decisions (what gets accepted into core modules, branch/PR policy for that repo). Specific to that project's own maintainership, not this one.

This fork also inherited a community dashboard, progress-sync path, and `tren community`/`tren login` commands from the codebase we forked from; the backend they talked to (`mlsysbook.ai`, Netlify, Supabase) belonged to the original TinyTorch project, not TrenTorch, so they never worked standalone here. That code, along with the Quarto-based docs site it shipped alongside, has since been removed rather than kept as dead code pointing at someone else's infrastructure. Where the docs below still reference this history, it's marked as removed, not upstream-only.

## On "TinyTorch" vs "TrenTorch" in these docs

Everything in this fork's own code, CLI output, and docs is TrenTorch now, including the `tren system logo` command's own narrative -- there's no longer a separate in-product "TinyTorch" identity to preserve. "TinyTorch" only appears where a doc is naming the actual upstream project by name (the Harvard course this fork started from, its own repository, tags, or workflows) -- never as this fork's own branding.
