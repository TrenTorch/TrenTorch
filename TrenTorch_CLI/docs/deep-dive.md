# TrenTorch: How It Actually Works, From First Principles

*Every claim in this document is sourced from reading the actual code: `bin/tren`, `platforms/cli/main.py`, `platforms/cli/core/*.py`, `platforms/cli/**/*.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `data/trentorch/__init__.py`, cross-checked against a real TrenTorch environment on disk (measured directory sizes, not estimates). Where the code has an if/else branch, both branches are described. Where a described feature exists only in an open, unmerged pull request rather than on `dev`, that is stated explicitly, not silently assumed. Originally written when this fork inherited the upstream `harvard-edge/cs249r_book` repository's `tito` source close to verbatim; this fork has since undergone its own `data/` and `platforms/` restructurings independent of upstream, and this pass updates the paths and counts below to match, without re-deriving every claim from scratch. This fork also inherited upstream's `install.sh` (a one-line-curl installer hardcoded to upstream's own hosted URL and repo) and the optional community backend it could talk to; both have since been removed rather than kept pointing at someone else's infrastructure (see [`design.md`](design.md#community-dashboard-and-progress-sync-removed)).*

## Part 1: Two Ways To Invoke `tren`

Upstream's one-line-curl installer (`quarto/install.sh`) has been removed from this fork along with the rest of the Quarto-hosted content; it was hardcoded to upstream's own URL and repository and never usable as an install path for TrenTorch itself. Setup here goes through `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .` (see [`implementation.md`](implementation.md#prerequisites)) instead.

There are two entry points into the resulting code, and they resolve `sys.path` differently:

```text
Path A: the installed console script (created by `pip install -e .`)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  .venv/Scripts/tren.exe   (Windows)   or   .venv/bin/tren   (Unix)
        │
        │  This is a tiny compiled/generated launcher that pip creates
        │  from the `[project.scripts] tren = "platforms.cli.main:main"` entry in
        │  pyproject.toml. It only exists once `pip install -e .` has run,
        │  and only works once the venv is activated (or its Scripts/bin
        │  directory is on PATH).
        ▼
  platforms.cli.main:main()

Path B: bin/tren (a plain Python script, no pip install required)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  python bin/tren <command>
        │
        │  Explicitly computes trentorch_root from its own file location
        │  (two directories up from bin/tren), inserts it at the FRONT
        │  of sys.path, and os.chdir()'s into it before importing
        │  anything, so `Path.cwd()`-based logic throughout the CLI
        │  behaves correctly regardless of where the script was invoked
        │  from. This exists for CI and for anyone who doesn't want an
        │  editable pip install at all.
        ▼
  platforms.cli.main:main()      (same function, same code, either way)
```

Both paths converge on the exact same `main()`, the difference is only in how `sys.path` and the working directory get set up before that function runs.

---

## Part 2: What Happens Every Single Time You Type `tren ...`

Before any subcommand's own logic runs, `platforms/cli/main.py`'s `TrenTorchCLI` does the same fixed sequence, every time, regardless of which command was typed.

                          $ tren module start 01

│    Without this, the emoji this CLI prints everywhere (✅❌🔥) raises   │
│    an unhandled UnicodeEncodeError and crashes with a raw traceback    │
│    on most Windows terminals, since the interpreter's default stream   │
│    encoding there is a legacy codepage (e.g. cp1252), not UTF-8.       │

│    - Registers 12 dict entries into one dict (main.py's own comment    │

│      same TUICommand: setup, system, module, dev, package, milestone,  │

```

None of steps 1–6 touch the network or spawn a subprocess. They're all local: reading env vars, walking the filesystem for `pyproject.toml`, importing already-installed packages. The first point at which *anything* leaves the machine or spawns a new OS process depends entirely on which subcommand you ran.

## Part 3: The Core Student Loop, `start` → edit → `complete`

This is the loop a student repeats 20 times (once per module). Each module is independent curriculum content (a tensor library, then activations, then layers...), but the *mechanics* of starting and completing one are identical every time.

### 3.1 Module identity: there is no hardcoded module list

`platforms/cli/core/modules.py`'s `_discover_modules()` scans `data/src/` at runtime for directories matching the regex `^(\d{2})_(\w+)$` and builds the number→folder mapping from whatever it finds, cached with `@lru_cache`. **Nothing enumerates "there are 20 modules" as a constant anywhere in this discovery path.** If a 21st `data/src/21_whatever/` directory existed, it would simply appear. (Other parts of the codebase, like the milestone system's `PRIMARY_EXPORT_LABELS` dict, do hardcode 01-20 as display labels; that's a separate, static lookup table, not the module registry itself.)

### 3.2 `tren module start 01`, full decision tree

                                                     the project root, then

                                                     notebook in it.
```

**A currently-real dead end worth naming precisely.** `started_modules` in `user_data/progress.json` and the actual notebook on disk under `data/modules/` are two independently-maintained facts, and nothing keeps them in sync. `tren system reset --keep-progress` is a documented command that deliberately clears `data/modules/` while intentionally leaving `started_modules` untouched. Hit that combination (or lose `data/modules/` some other way, e.g. a partial restore from backup) and `tren module start N` will refuse forever with "already started," pointing at `tren module resume N`. Resume, in turn, accepts (tracking says started) and only discovers the notebook is missing deep inside `open_jupyter` (`platforms/cli/commands/jupyter.py`), failing with "Module directory not found" and no further guidance. Neither command's own error message mentions the actual fix, `tren module reset N --force`, which does work. A pull request fixing exactly this (both commands checking whether the notebook genuinely exists before trusting the tracking flag, and recreating it from `data/src/` when it doesn't) is open at the time of writing (harvard-edge/cs249r_book#2026), not yet merged.

### 3.3 Jupyter server lifecycle: one shared server, not one per launch

This used to be a real gap: every `tren module start/resume/view` call spawned a brand-new `jupyter lab` subprocess with no tracking, so five calls in one session meant five separate servers, none of which `tren` would ever stop. Fixed 2026-08-23: `platforms/cli/commands/jupyter.py`'s `find_running_jupyter_server()` reads live state from `jupyter server list` (not a PID `tren` tracks itself, so it self-heals if the server was closed outside `tren`'s control) and `open_jupyter()` reuses that server if one is already rooted at the project root, only calling `start_jupyter_server()` to spawn one when none exists. The same file also owns `resolve_jupyter_ui()` (the Notebook-or-Lab prompt) and `register_jupyter_magic()` (scoping the `%tren` magic to the `trentorch` kernel, called from `tren setup`) — the whole Jupyter component's process logic lives in this one file rather than being split across `processes/module_workflow/workflow.py`, `cli_platform/setup.py`, and `jupyter_magic.py` the way it originally grew.

### 3.4 What Jupyter Lab actually costs, once it's running

Once `jupyter lab` is up, it's a real local web server: it binds a TCP port (8888 by default, and every additional untracked instance from 3.3 binds the next free one), runs a Python kernel process per open notebook (a second Python process, separate from the `tren` process that launched it), and serves a JavaScript frontend over HTTP to whatever browser tab it opens. This is the only point in the entire student workflow where a long-lived network listener exists on the machine, every other `tren` command starts, does its work, and exits.

---

## Part 4: `tren module complete`, The Four-Step Pipeline

This is the command that actually turns a student's edited notebook into working, importable code. It is the single most consequential command in the whole system, and it is **not** the same thing as `tren module test` (that only runs Step 1 and never touches the package).

## Part 5: The Two Conversions Students Confuse (and Why They're Different Tools)

There are exactly two file-format conversions in this whole system, and they run at different times, use different libraries, and go in different directions:

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CONVERSION A: jupytext (data/src/*.py  ->  data/modules/*.ipynb)            │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────    │
│  WHEN:    tren module start N   (only if the notebook doesn't      │
│           already exist)                                           │
│  RUNS AS: an external subprocess (jupytext --to ipynb ...)         │
│  READS:   the INSTRUCTOR's data/src/NN_name/NN_name.py                  │
│  WRITES:  data/modules/NN_name/name.ipynb , the file the student      │
│           actually opens and edits in Jupyter                       │
│  PURPOSE: turn plain "percent-format" Python (# %% cell markers)   │
│           into a real, openable .ipynb notebook, ONCE, so the      │
│           student has something to work in.                        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CONVERSION B: nbdev (data/modules/*.ipynb  ->  trentorch/**/*.py)       │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────    │
│  WHEN:    tren module complete N   (every single time, not just    │
│           once)                                                     │
│  RUNS AS: an in-process Python function call (nb_export)           │
│  READS:   the STUDENT's edited data/modules/NN_name/name.ipynb          │
│  WRITES:  data/trentorch/core/name.py (or perf/, or olympics/),  the  │
│           real Python package a student can `import trentorch`     │
│  PURPOSE: turn the student's notebook cells marked `#| export`     │
│           into a real, importable module, EVERY time they complete │
│           the module (so re-running `complete` after a fix         │
│           legitimately re-generates the package file).             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Confusing these two is exactly the mistake the docs call out explicitly: `tren module test N` alone never runs Conversion B, only `tren module complete N` does. A student who tests repeatedly but never runs `complete` never actually gets their work into `trentorch/`.

There is a **third**, separate export path, `tren dev export`, that a developer/maintainer uses to rebuild the *entire curriculum* by running Conversion A for every module (overwriting student notebooks, which `module start`'s version deliberately never does) and then Conversion B for every module. This is explicitly a maintainer tool, not part of the student loop.

**Every module in the normal 20-module student loop is 100% offline.** This fork previously had an optional `tren community login` / progress-sync path (a browser-based login plus a POST to a hosted backend after completing a module or milestone); it talked to the original TinyTorch project's own infrastructure, was never usable from this fork, and has since been removed along with the rest of the community/docs-site code (see [`design.md`](design.md#community-dashboard-and-progress-sync-removed)). The table above no longer includes it.

---

## Part 7: The Test Gatekeeper, Why `conftest.py` Exists At All

This is the single most important defensive mechanism in the whole codebase, and it exists because of a specific, structural danger in how `trentorch/__init__.py` is written:

```python
try:
    from .core.tensor import Tensor
except ImportError:
    Tensor = None
```text

Every one of the 20 module imports in `trentorch/__init__.py` follows this exact pattern. It has to: a student who has only completed 3 of 20 modules needs `import trentorch` to work at all, not crash because module 15 doesn't exist yet. But the cost of that design is real: **if a module's export is broken or missing, `Tensor` silently becomes `None` instead of raising an error.** A test that does `assert Tensor is not None` correctly catches this, but a test that does something like `x = Tensor([1,2,3])` when `Tensor` is `None` raises a plain `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable`, which is a confusing failure that doesn't point at the real cause. Worse, a badly-written test that doesn't actually exercise the imported symbol can pass vacuously while testing nothing.

`tests/conftest.py`'s `pytest_configure` hook runs **before any test in the whole suite**. As of the current `dev` branch, here is exactly what it checks, no more and no less:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│                                                                     │
│ Any single failure across all three checks -> pytest.UsageError,   │
│ which aborts the ENTIRE pytest session immediately, before a       │
│ single test runs, printing the exact `tren dev export --all` fix. │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```text

**This only ever checks modules 01-04.** Modules 05 through 20 are not examined by this gate at all right now, hard or soft. A broken or missing export in, say, module 12 (Attention) is invisible to this specific check; whatever silent-`None` failure it's meant to guard against for module 12 would have to be caught by that module's own tests, if they happen to exercise the right symbol directly.

An open, unmerged pull request (harvard-edge/cs249r_book#2023) proposes replacing this with a full 20-module registry and a two-tier hard/soft strategy (foundational modules 01-04 still hard-fail; modules 05-20 would get a non-blocking stderr warning instead of no check at all). That is a real, reviewed, but not-yet-merged change, described here so it isn't confused with what's actually running today.

This can be bypassed entirely with `TRENTORCH_SKIP_EXPORT_CHECK=1`, used by the codebase's own test suite so that testing other things doesn't trigger this gate recursively.

Nothing in this system uses a GPU. `numpy` is the only numerical dependency (`requirements.txt`), and every tensor operation a student implements runs on the CPU via NumPy's own (typically multi-threaded, BLAS-backed) array operations, the CPU cost scales with whatever NumPy operations a student's own code calls, not anything TrenTorch adds on top.

## Summary: The One-Sentence Version of Every Part

1. **Install**: a single Bash script does a sparse, blob-filtered, shallow git clone of one subdirectory of a monorepo, then builds a venv and pip-installs into it, nothing else is downloaded, and every network/subprocess step has an explicit timeout after a real prior bug where one didn't.
2. **Every `tren` invocation**: fixes Windows encoding, resolves the project root by walking up for `pyproject.toml`, builds argument parsers for all 10 command groups regardless of which one you're using, refuses to run outside a venv (except `setup`), then dispatches.
3. **`module start`**: checks tracking state, self-heals if that state has desynced from the actual files on disk, checks prerequisites, converts `data/src/*.py` to a notebook via a real `jupytext` subprocess if one doesn't exist, and optionally spawns a real, currently-untracked, long-lived `jupyter lab` server.
4. **`module complete`**: a strict four-step pipeline (instructor-reference unit tests, notebook syntax check, real `nbdev` export of the student's own cells into a real Python file, then pytest against that just-exported package) where any failure stops everything before progress is ever recorded.
5. **Two separate conversions** exist and are easy to confuse: `jupytext` runs once, source→notebook, at `start` time; `nbdev` runs every time, notebook→package, at `complete` time.
6. **Network calls are rare and optional**: an optional update check is the only one left, the entire 20-module curriculum works completely offline.
7. **The test gatekeeper exists because of a specific danger**: `trentorch/__init__.py`'s `try/except ImportError: X = None` pattern means a broken export can silently become `None` instead of an error, so `conftest.py` hard-fails the whole test session if the four foundational modules aren't properly exported before any test runs; modules 05-20 aren't covered by this check yet (a fix that would extend it to all 20 is open, unmerged).
8. **No GPU is used anywhere**; every operation is either pure Python/JSON bookkeeping, a subprocess (`jupytext`, `pytest`, a plain `python` script, `jupyter lab`), or NumPy math on the CPU.
