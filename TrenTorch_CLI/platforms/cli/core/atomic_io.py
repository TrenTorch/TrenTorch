"""
Atomic JSON reads and writes for the CLI's own state files (progress.json,
milestones.json, benchmark results, ...).

Every save used to write via `open(path, "w")` followed by
`json.dump(...)`. `open(path, "w")` truncates the file to 0 bytes the
moment it's called, before a single byte of the new content is written --
so anything short of a clean process exit between that truncation and
json.dump() finishing (a crash, Ctrl+C, power loss, OOM kill) leaves a
truncated, unparseable file on disk. Every read site for these files
already wraps json.load() in a broad except that resets to an empty
default on JSONDecodeError, which means an interrupted save doesn't just
lose the write in progress -- it silently erases everything that was
already saved, with zero indication to the user.

os.replace() is atomic on both POSIX and Windows: a reader can only ever
see the old complete file or the new complete file, never a partial one.
Writing the new content to a temp file in the same directory first (same
filesystem, so the rename is guaranteed atomic rather than falling back
to a slower non-atomic copy) and only replacing the real path once that
write has fully succeeded gets the same durability every other line of
this codebase already assumes state files have.

atomic_write_json() closes the write-side half of that hazard. The other
half is the read side: even with atomic writes, a file can still end up
corrupted by something outside this CLI's control (a manual edit gone
wrong, a disk error, an old pre-atomic-write crash from before this fix
existed). Every read site used to catch that with a bare
`except (OSError, json.JSONDecodeError): pass` and silently fall back to
an empty default -- so a student whose real progress.json exists on disk
but can't be parsed just sees "0/20 modules complete" with no hint that
their actual data might still be sitting right there, unreadable. Command
output is not the place to explain that; the moment the file fails to
parse is. read_json_or_warn() prints a specific, actionable message right
then (the exact path, the exact error, and what to do about it) before
falling back to the same default the old silent code used -- the CLI
still works, but the user finds out why their progress looks wrong
instead of being left to assume it's just gone.
