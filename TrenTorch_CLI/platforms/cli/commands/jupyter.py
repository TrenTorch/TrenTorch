"""The Jupyter component's process logic, all in one place.

Everything `tren` does with Jupyter lives here: choosing Notebook vs
Lab, finding or starting the one shared server a project uses, opening
a module's notebook in it, and scoping the `%tren` magic to the
`trentorch` kernel. This used to be split three ways (server lifecycle
in module/workflow.py, magic registration in commands/setup.py, the
magic itself in jupyter_magic.py) purely because each piece got added
at a different time; the component is one thing, so its process logic
lives in one file. tren/jupyter_magic.py stays separate on purpose:
that file has to import cleanly inside a Jupyter kernel with no `tren`
CLI context at all, which is a real constraint this module doesn't
share.
