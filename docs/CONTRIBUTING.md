# Contributing to TrenTorch 🔥

Thanks for your interest in contributing! By participating, you're expected to uphold the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

TrenTorch is an educational ML framework, so every contribution should make things clearer for someone learning, not just more "correct" in the abstract:

- **Enhance learning** — make concepts clearer for students
- **Preserve the learning progression** — don't skip ahead of what a module has taught by that point
- **Keep it simple** — educational clarity over production complexity

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TrenTorch/TrenTorch.git
cd TrenTorch
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ./
```

Then verify it works:

```bash
tren --version
tren system health
tren module status
```

Also worth a look: `docs/design.md` (educational context and teaching approach), `README.md` (repo structure), and the [wiki](https://github.com/TrenTorch/TrenTorch/wiki) (curriculum overview, CLI reference, architecture).

## The contribution process, end to end

This is the full loop, from noticing something to seeing your fix merged. The individual steps are covered in more detail further down (Opening an issue, Testing, Opening a pull request), this section is just the order they happen in.

1. **Open an issue first.** Bug report or feature request, whichever fits (see "Opening an issue" below for what to include). Check the existing issues first so you're not duplicating one already open.
2. **Ask to be assigned to it.** Comment on the issue asking, or wait for a maintainer to assign it. This is required for first-time and external contributors so two people don't quietly work on the same fix, and so a maintainer can weigh in before you've sunk time into an approach that might not land. If you're already coordinating with the team on ongoing work, this step doesn't apply to you.
3. **Branch off `dev`, not `main`.** `dev` is this repo's default branch and where every PR should target; `main` is only updated periodically by merging `dev` into it once things are stable. See "Workflow" below for the exact commands.
4. **Make your change, and test it.** Run the relevant `tren module test`/`pytest` commands locally before pushing (see "Testing" below).
5. **Open the PR, referencing the issue** (e.g. `Fixes #123`). A bot checks for this on first-time/external PRs and labels it `needs-linked-issue` if it's missing.
6. **Wait for CI and review.** CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) has to be green, and at least one approving review from someone other than the PR's author is required before it can merge.

## Workflow

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b your-github-username/your-improvement

# make your changes, then test them
pytest tests/
tren module test 01

git add <specific-files>    # not `git add .`, stage files explicitly
git commit -m "Fix tensor broadcasting bug in Module 02"
git push origin your-github-username/your-improvement
# then open a PR on GitHub targeting dev
```

- **Branch names**: `<github-username>/<feature-name>`, lowercase, hyphens (e.g. `shivtej/fix-attention-mask`). Not `feature/`, not a bare description, your username first, always.
- **Never work directly on `dev` or `main`.**
- **Always use the virtual environment.**

## Testing

```bash
tren module test NN         # e.g. tren module test 01 -- one module's own tests
pytest tests/integration/    # cross-module integration tests
pytest tests/                # everything: integration, regression, e2e
pytest platforms/cli/tests/  # the tren CLI's own test suite
```

CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) has to be green before a PR merges — see it run on your own PR rather than only trusting local results.

## Code standards

**Students** (using the framework): work in `data/modules/NN_name/name.ipynb` in Jupyter; export with `tren module complete N`.

**Contributors** (improving the framework itself): edit `data/src/NN_name/NN_name.py` (the source of truth); notebooks are generated from it via `tren dev export`. Include:

- immediate tests after each implementation
- memory/performance analysis where it's relevant to the module's own systems focus
- clear explanations — clarity is the actual point of this codebase

## Opening an issue

**Bug report**: what happened vs. what you expected, exact steps to reproduce (the `tren` commands or notebook cells), the error output, and your OS + `tren --version` / `python --version`.

**Feature request**: what's missing or confusing, what you'd want instead, and any alternatives you considered.

Security issues should **not** go through a public issue — see [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) for the private reporting flow.

**If you're new here**: open the issue first, and ask to be assigned to it before starting work. This avoids two people quietly duplicating the same fix, and lets a maintainer weigh in before you've sunk time into an approach that might not land. (Existing collaborators already coordinating with the team are exempt from this — it's aimed at first PRs, not routine ongoing work.)

## Opening a pull request

Describe what changed and why, how you tested it, and confirm `ruff check` / `ruff format --check` pass locally (a bot also runs these automatically and pushes any straightforward fix directly onto your branch). Keep PRs scoped to one thing — a bug fix and an unrelated refactor in the same PR is harder to review and harder to revert if something's wrong.

If you're a first-time or external contributor, reference the issue you were assigned in the PR description (e.g. `Fixes #123`) — a bot checks for this and will comment/label the PR `needs-linked-issue` if it's missing, though a maintainer still makes the actual call on merging. Every PR also needs at least one approving review from someone other than its author before it can merge.

## Releases (maintainers)

[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) — patch for fixes, minor for new features/modules, major for breaking changes. There's no automated release pipeline yet: `pyproject.toml`'s version is bumped by hand, and changes land by merging to `main` once CI is green. Contributors don't need to think about version bumps.
